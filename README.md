# Intelligent SQL-agent and RAG System for Chatting with Multiple Databases

This project demonstrates how to build an agentic system using Large Language Models (LLMs) that can interact with multiple databases and utilize various tools. It highlights the use of SQL agents to efficiently query large databases. The key frameworks used in this project include OpenAI, LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith, and Gradio. The end product is an end-to-end chatbot, designed to perform these tasks, with LangSmith used to monitor the performance of the agents.
